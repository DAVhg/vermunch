Vermunch
Welcome to Vermunch, a new vermut brand's website!

Description
Vermunch is a simple webpage designed to showcase our brand's logo on a vibrant red background. This webpage serves as the online presence for our vermut brand, providing visitors with a visually appealing introduction to our product.

Getting Started
To view the website locally, simply download the HTML file (index.html) and the logo image (your-logo-white.png). Make sure both files are in the same directory. Then, open the index.html file in a web browser to see the webpage.

Usage
The webpage displays our brand's logo prominently on a red background. Visitors can see the logo and get a sense of our brand identity. No additional text or information is provided on the webpage to keep the design minimalistic and focused.
